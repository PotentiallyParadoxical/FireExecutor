# FireExecutor
Fire is my personal Krnl based Roblox executor, a relic from my Roblox exploit days.

Fire, is based on Axon UI and has a randomized name when it runs. It has a Monaco based editor for working with scripts internally and also supports a open file feature to import scripts from file form.

It's based off and depends on the Krnl dll which can be obtained at their site, https://krnl.ca/.

I'm not going to include instructions for how to set it up but if you are intrested in doing so feel free to contact me.
